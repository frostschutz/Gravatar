Gravatar Plugin for MyBB
------------------------

Installation Instructions:

Upload inc/plugins/gravatar.php and inc/languages/english/gravatar.lang.php
to the respective folders in your MyBB installation.

If you are using a language other than English, upload another copy of the 
language file to inc/languages/<yourlanguage>/gravatar.lang.php. You can 
also edit and translate this file to your language (only three strings).

Then you can activate the plugin in the Admin CP.
